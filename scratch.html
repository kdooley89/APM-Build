          Terry is that rare technologist who also speaks business—taking real customer needs and goals and turning them into cutting edge products. A born leader, he graduated from West Point (where he played goalkeeper on the soccer team) and was awarded the Bronze Star while leading a combat engineering unit during Operation Desert Storm. His teams here at Dynatrace will tell you that he’s focused, competitive, determined, a great motivator and gifted consensus builder. He will tell you he just likes to get things done right the first time. Having been with Compuware/Dynatrace for more than 16 years, Terry holds a patent for performance management technology. Oh, and he’s learning photography in his “spare” time.
